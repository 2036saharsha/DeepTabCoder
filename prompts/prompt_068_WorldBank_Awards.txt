Task: Given a table and a question, the goal is to write a Python program to answer the question using the provided dataset.

Steps:

1. Define necessary functions that can be reused for other problems in this type of task.
2. Ensure that functions are general and flexible enough to be reused in different questions or tables.
3. Define a main function called solution(table_data) that accepts the table data as input and returns the answer to the question.
4. Import pandas, load the dataset, analyze its structure, and run the solution function.
5. Ensure no hallucination of non-existent table headers and structure.
6. Avoid making assumptions about missing or empty column headers.
7. Make sure the code is modular and reusable for various queries on the table.

Dataset Format: The dataset will always be structured as follows:

TABLE:

| Supplier Contract Amount (USD) | 157840.9 |


Question: What is the contract amount for the supplier 'RESOLVE SYSTEMS LIMITED' in USD?

Solution Example Code:

import pandas as pd

def load_data(file_path):
    try:
        df = pd.read_parquet(file_path)
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading data from {file_path}: {e}")
        return None

def get_row_by_name(df, key):
    # Check if the column exists in the DataFrame and return its value in the first row
    if key in df.columns:
        return df[key].iloc[0]
    return None

# Solution Function
def solution(df):
    # Filter the DataFrame for the row where the supplier is 'RESOLVE SYSTEMS LIMITED'
    supplier_row = df[df['Supplier'] == 'RESOLVE SYSTEMS LIMITED']

    # Get the Supplier Contract Amount (USD)
    supplier_contract_amount = get_row_by_name(supplier_row, 'Supplier Contract Amount (USD)')

    return supplier_contract_amount

# Example usage with a loaded dataset, always use this path
df = load_data("../data/datasets/competition/068_WorldBank_Awards/all.parquet")
# Just print the solution as shown below, do not print anything else
print(solution(df))

Answer: 157840.9

Note: The load_data function should be flexible enough to handle various datasets. Similarly, get_row_by_name is a general helper function for retrieving a value from a specific column by name.

Types of Answers Expected:

Boolean: Valid answers include True/False, Y/N, Yes/No (all case insensitive).
Category: A value from a cell (or a substring of a cell) in the dataset.
Number: A numerical value from a cell in the dataset, which may represent a computed statistic (e.g., average, maximum, minimum).
List[category]: A list containing a fixed number of categories. The expected format is: "['cat', 'dog']". Pay attention to the wording of the question to determine if uniqueness is required or if repeated values are allowed.
List[number]: Similar to List[category], but with numbers as its elements.
