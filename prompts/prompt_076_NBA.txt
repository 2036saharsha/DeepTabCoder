Task: Given a table and a question, the goal is to write a Python program to answer the question using the provided dataset.

Steps:

1. Define necessary functions that can be reused for other problems in this type of task.
2. Ensure that functions are general and flexible enough to be reused in different questions or tables.
3. Define a main function called solution(table_data) that accepts the table data as input and returns the answer to the question.
4. Import pandas, load the dataset, analyze its structure, and run the solution function.
5. Ensure no hallucination of non-existent table headers and structure.
6. Avoid making assumptions about missing or empty column headers.
7. Make sure the code is modular and reusable for various queries on the table.

Dataset Format: The dataset will always be structured as follows:

TABLE:

Question: How many PTS did Kevin Durant score for OKC in the 2012-13 season?

Solution Example Code:

import pandas as pd

def load_data(file_path):
    try:
        df = pd.read_parquet(file_path)
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading data from {file_path}: {e}")
        return None
        
# Get the row by name (case-insensitive)
def get_row_by_name(df, key):
    # Perform case-insensitive search for the key in the columns
    for column in df.columns:
        if column.lower() == key.lower():
            return column
    return None

def solution(df):
    # Player and Team to search for in the question
    player_to_find = "Kevin Durant" 
    team_to_find = "OKC"
    
    # Ensure case-insensitive column search
    player_column = get_row_by_name(df, "PLAYER")  
    team_column = get_row_by_name(df, "TEAM")  
    points_column = get_row_by_name(df, "PTS") 

    if player_column and team_column and points_column:
        # Filter the row based on both Player and Team
        player_team_row = df[(df[player_column] == player_to_find) & (df[team_column] == team_to_find)]
        
        # Return the Points (PTS) for that specific player and team
        if not player_team_row.empty:
            return player_team_row[points_column].iloc[0]
        else:
            return None  # Return None if no matching record is found
    return None

# Example usage with a loaded dataset, always use this path
df = load_data("../data/datasets/competition/076_NBA/all.parquet")
# Just print the solution as shown below, do not print anything else
print(solution(df))

Answer: 2280

Note: The load_data function should be flexible enough to handle various datasets. Similarly, get_row_by_name is a general helper function for retrieving a value from a specific column by name.

Types of Answers Expected:

Boolean: Valid answers include True/False, Y/N, Yes/No (all case insensitive).
Category: A value from a cell (or a substring of a cell) in the dataset.
Number: A numerical value from a cell in the dataset, which may represent a computed statistic (e.g., average, maximum, minimum).
List[category]: A list containing a fixed number of categories. The expected format is: "['cat', 'dog']". Pay attention to the wording of the question to determine if uniqueness is required or if repeated values are allowed.
List[number]: Similar to List[category], but with numbers as its elements.
